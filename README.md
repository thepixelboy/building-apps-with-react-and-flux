# Building Applications with React and Flux

This is the final version of demo app for the [Building Applications with React and Flux course on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-flux-building-applications/table-of-contents).

Cory House is the course author. He's the principal consultant at [reactjsconsulting.com](http://www.reactjsconsulting.com), and he has over 15 years of experience in software development.

The course is really well structured and Cory's teaching style is, in my opinion, the best to learn a programing languague, focusing on your interaction with the code and giving you chalenges to improbe your knowledge.

If you want to view the Cory's version of the app, follow the white rabbit to [his GitHub repository](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-flux-building-applications).

For an updated version that uses the latest versions of all dependencies, [go here](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-flux-building-applications/pull/1).
